# The Project

### The genesis of the idea

The first idea for the project was to create a portable swing with hooks to append it to a tree branch. Unfortunately I couldn't manage to come up with an idea for a modular pattern able to evely distribute the forces applied by the weight of an adult person. Considering the constraint on the maximum thickness of 1mm, I thought that it would have been too ambitious given also the short time to finish the prototype and thus I decided to explore other alternatives that exploited better the characteristics of the given material (AllPHA).

One of the characteristics of the material that I really wanted to explore is its ability to biodegradate. 
Since it's not clear the time required to complete the degradation process, I started running some experiments placing pieces of different thickness (and printed with different temperatures) in a glass of water exposed to sunlight and some other pieces with the same characteristics buried under muddy ground.

While the experiment goes on by itself (I guess it would require at least 3 or 4 weeks to see some noticeable degradation) I decided to exploit the aforementioned property of the material designing a little bucket that birds can use as a structure to build their nests on.Unfortunately, I think I'll have to wait till april or may to try to place the first prototype on a tree since, according to my researches, birds don't usually build their nests during winter.

The design of the modules is composed of the initial letters of my name: M and A, they should be designed in a way that makes them easy to link in various poitisions depending on the final desired shape.

### The software

I decided to design the whole prototype using Tinkercad® since I have previous experience with this software and since the project has to be completed in only seven weeks I thought it was a wise idea to focus more on the printing process rather than on learning a new tool to design the pieces. 

# 1st week

**The design**

The first design featured an A and an M as shown in the next image:

As soon as I tried to place the pieces as I imagined them it was clear that this design of the A left a big hole in the center of the circle, so I proceeded with the successive iteration of the design solving the issue and adding a second linking hole making the whole structure stronger.

**First prints and experiments with temperature and thickness** 

For the first try I tried to print with the maximum temperature suggested by the filament manufacturer: 200°C.
Unfortunately the print suffered a severe warping and I was forced to stop it at around 4mm of thickness.

 This problem actually led to an interesting discovery! 
 The pieces that i planned to print with 1mm thickness were actually perfect with a ~0.5mm thickness! The balance between strenght and flexibility seemed amazing for my project.

 I still have to understand the right settings to fix the warping problems but it seems like, overall, this road is the right one.

I tried with 190, 180 and bla bla
