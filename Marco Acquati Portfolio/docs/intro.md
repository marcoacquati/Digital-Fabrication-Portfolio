# Marco Acquati
Double degree MSc student in Human Computer Interaction and Design @ PoliMi & Université Paris-Saclay.

I’m a versatile computer engineer with experience in project management and software development. I have been passionate about computer science since I was a child, consequently my academic career was soon directed towards a degree in computer science and engineering. I believe in a world where technology can improve people's lives, without being intrusive or forced.
